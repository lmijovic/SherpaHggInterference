To use a model generated by the FeynRules package
@mycite{Christensen2008py},@mycite{Christensen2009jx}, the model must be
made available to Sherpa by running
@verbatim
  <prefix>/bin/Sherpa-generate-model <path-to-ufo-model>
@end verbatim
where <path-to-ufo-model> specifies the location of the directory where
the UFO model can be found. This requires Python version 2.6 or later
and an installation of SCons. Furthermore, Sherpa must be compiled with
Python suppert using @option{--enable-pyext}, as described in
@xref{Installation}.

The above command generates source code for the UFO model, compiles it,
and installs the corresponding library, making it available for event
generation. Python, SCons, and the UFO model directory are not required
for event generation once the above command has finished.

An example run card will be written to the working directory while the
model is generated with @code{Sherpa-generate-model}. This run card
shows the syntax for the respective model parameters and can be used as
a template. It is also possible to use an external parameter card by
specifying the path to the card with the switch @option{UFO_PARAM_CARD}
in the @code{(run)@{...@}(run)} section of the run card. Relative and
absolute file paths are allowed. This option allows it to use the native
UFO parameter cards, as used by MadGraph for example.

Note that the use of the SM switches @option{MASS[<id>]},
@option{MASSIVE[<id>]}, @option{WIDTH[<id>]}, and @option{STABLE[<id>]}
is discouraged when using UFO models as the UFO model completely defines
all particle properties and their relation to the independent model
parameters. These model parameters should be set using the standard UFO
parameter syntax as shown in the example run card generated by the
@code{Sherpa-generate-model} command. 

For parts of the simulation other than the hard process (hadronization,
underlying event, running of the SM couplings) Sherpa uses internal
default values for the Standard Model fermion masses if they are
massless in the UFO model. This is necessary for a meaningful
simulation. In the hard process however, the UFO model masses are always
respected.

Please note that AMEGIC can only be used for the built-in models (SM and
HEFT). The use of UFO models is only supported by Comix.

@c @node MSSM
@c @subsection Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model

@c The MSSM is implemented via UFO, cf. 
@c @uref{https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/MSSM}.
@c In order to use this model, Sherpa must be installed with python support,
@c using @option{--enable-pyext}, as described in @xref{Installation}.
@c Once installed, the model is made available to Sherpa by running
@c @verbatim
@c   Sherpa-generate-model MODEL/MSSM
